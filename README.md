# The Site of Ateto

This is a personal site developed by Dong-Yi Su aka Ateto using React.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS and Material UI, packaged and unit tested and E2E tested using Vite, Jest and Playwright.

The architectural design adopts MVC architecture and adheres to the abstraction principle, providing each component with an almost pure interface to achieve low coupling, high modularity and high testability.
